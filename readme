## Overview

This web app simulates a generalized User Interface of a Heme Analyzer.  Sample data is retrieved from Google sheets.  
This allows instructors to generate sample date for various use cases.

## Development

### Set Up

To connect to Google sheets, an App Key is required, and was generated from [Cloud Developer Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials?project=quickstart-1556582949982).  

**NB** The current AppKey (`API Key MedLab`) is generated on BCITVie's account and is restricted to the testing domains specified in the console management.  

The `AppKey` should be stored in a `./.env`.
